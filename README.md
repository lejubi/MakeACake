# Make A Cake
AP CS Midyear Project

## Project Description
We will be creating a make-your-own-cake adventure where you can customize your cakeâ€™s shape, flavor, frosting, and decorations. Highlights will include a seamless customizing experience, elaborate artwork, and relaxing background music. After completing your scrumptious cake, you can send it to your friends to tell them happy birthday or with another simple message.
